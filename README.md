I just finished building my social media app called deck, it shows you other users within a certain range you set it in. It also let you post text posts for other people to see, you can also send messages and follow other users.
The whole thing was build using react native (for frontend), node.js and postgres(for backend). 
It was an amazing project which taught me how to take something from 0 and scale it to a finished product. There are still many things to learn about social media app development but that's a good start i think

In this repo you can find the deck-master which manages the database and the deck-server which is the server that connects the database with the react native app. Due to the app's folder size i could not upload it using git
so here is the google drive link for the social-media code.
